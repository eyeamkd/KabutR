<h3> Problem That i faced : </h3> 
</hr> 
<p> I have recently joined an organization, as a SDE Intern, every morning after coming to my office, i had to 
send a mail to my mentors and trainers as to what was i going to do in that particular day. <br/> 
Every evening, i had to send a daily report to the same people </p> 

</hr> 

<h3> My Solution : </h3>  

<p> Made a NodeJS script, and integrated it with my Telegram Bot, i could send messages all day long to my bot and my bot would then at 
a specified time send a nicely formatted email to my bosses </p>
